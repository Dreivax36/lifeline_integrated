## Getting Started

1. This is just a UI Design of the main screens for both the Mobile and Desktop Applications. 
2. It needs to be cleaned. By cleaned, removing redundant codes by making classes and etc.
3. Create the Home Page for all the users to see without logging in. i.e Getting Started, How It Works, Registration Page (both for Users and Establishments)
4. Currently there is no UI design for the following pages mentioned above.
5. If you can polish the current UI Design do so. But it would be much better to focus on the non-existent ones.
